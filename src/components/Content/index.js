                ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Giovani! A passionate back-end developer seeking my first professional opportunity. I specialize in building RESTful APIs with Node.js/Express and creating interactive front-end experiences with React.
                I'm eager to expand my knowledge in software architecture, best practices, and cutting-edge technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems, from optimizing algorithms to designing databases and enhancing UI.
                Outside of coding, I love video games, painting, and watching series. Excited to begin my tech journey! Check out my projects and connect with me on GitHub!
